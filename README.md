**This project is an evolving idea around "incentivizing civic action". For starters, we are building out a tool to optimize online meetings with a timer, an agenda builder using DraftJS, and screen/cam/mic sharing over Firebase.** 

*The hope is that better organized and guided conversations can turn all this rage into constructive action for our communities.*
